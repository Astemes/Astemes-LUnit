# LUnit

A LabVIEW Unit Testing Framework built on the [xUnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit) unit testing industry standard and inspired by [JKI VI Tester](https://github.com/JKISoftware/JKI-VI-Tester).

## Prerequisites

To use LUnit you will need to have LabVIEW 2020 or later installed.
As LUnit was developed using the LabVIEW Community Edition there is currently no support for older versions of LabVIEW.

## Installation

LUnit is easiest installed from the VIPM package and will soon be available through VIPM.

## Using LUnit

Once installed, LUnit is integrated into the LabVIEW development environment and the functionality is accessed through the Tools->LUnit menu.
From the menu, you may create a new tests or open the LUnit UI to run tests.
Tests may also be executed directly from the project explorer by right-clicking on a Test Case and selecting `Run Test Case...` from the menu.

## Examples

There are a few examples installed with LUnit and these may be found through the NI Example Finder using the keyword `LUnit`.
The examples are installed at `C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 20XX\examples\Asteme\LUnit` by default.
