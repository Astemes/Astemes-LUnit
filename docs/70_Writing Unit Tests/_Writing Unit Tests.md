As the topic is not a science, this section should be viewed as the views and opinions of the autor and not as facts.

## Why bother writing unit tests?

### Regression testing

Ensure existing behavior is not broken by new functionality.

Testing of timing
Global resources
Very slow tests
Breaking encapsulation

## Test harnesses

Overuse of setup and teardown
Use of private subVIs
